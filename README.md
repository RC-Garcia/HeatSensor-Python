# HeatSensor-Python
hypothetical digital temperature sensor and the Raspberry Pi GPIO library in Python
Remember to replace the heat_sensor_pin variable with the actual GPIO pin you have connected the heat sensor to.
This example assumes that the heat sensor provides a digital output (HIGH or LOW), and it continuously reads the sensor every second. You might need to refer to the datasheet of your specific temperature sensor to understand how to interface with it properly.
Note: If you're using a different platform (not a Raspberry Pi) or a different type of sensor, the code structure may need to be adapted accordingly.
